This is not a philological edition of the Libro Azzurro of Pietro Antonio Michiel’s herbal, but a work in progress starting from the 1940 edition of the first book.
Now you can find the partial transcription of the manuscript made by Ettore De Toni with his comment and notes – plus the image of the whole original text besides the plant drawings.
Further fundings and time will allow the transcription and online publication of the entire Michiel’s text.

In this online version the names of plants identified by Ettore De Toni are linked to [World Flora Online](http://www.worldfloraonline.org/) (for taxonomy and further scientific information) and, when available, to the [Kew Gardens Plants of the World Online](https://powo.science.kew.org/) where you can see photos, *specimina exiccata*, where the plant is native from where it is introduced etc.).

Names of people are linked to biographical repertories, when available; cited works to bibliographical permalinks;
names of places to [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/).
