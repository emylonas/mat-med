These lists provide access to people, places and citations that are mentioned in the Michiele text and the notes on each plant.

* [Index of People]({{ site.baseurl }}index-people)
* [Index of Places]({{ site.baseurl }}index-places) The index of places doesn't display properly right now because there is no master list in the header as there is of people.
