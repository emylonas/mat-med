# 16th-18th century Venetian Apothecary Shops

Starting from the natural substances, the last step to obtain a medicine was to process it in a professional laboratory – but remember that private kitchens as well were a sort of home-laboratories for pretty easy remedies.

In 1569, Venice had 85 apothecary shops, and by the early Seventeenth century the number had risen to over 100 (roughly one shop per 130 inhabitants, whereas today the proportion is of one pharmacy per 2,700 inhabitants).

A few among the many Venetian Apothecaries and apothecary shops were crucial sites in the urban and social fabric of the city: physicians and other medical professionals, noblemen and civil servants, artisans, people of middling sort status and servants met there, asking for medicinal compounds processed according to recipes, for raw and semi-processed substances. Benches ran along the walls where people waited for their turn and chatted: pharmacies offered shelter for sociability and leisure, spaces where to exchange news as well – and sometimes where political and religious heterodoxies matured.

But *Materia Medica* was the absolute protagonist: preserved in the storerooms, in the jars and vessels on display in the shop, and as a subject of conversation. At the Testa d'oro pharmacy of Rialto (its golden sign still hangs over Rialto bridge),

the magnificently illustrated herbal called 'Codice Rinio [but Roccabonella]' was on display for the use of experts, but also for the curious who wanted to see and know something more about plants.

In this section, through the transcription of a few inventories of apothecary shops, you will get an idea of how many natural substances – vegetable, but also animal and mineral ones – were available in an average shop of 16th-and 17th-century Venice. 

The inventories, with some entries highlighted to allow access to the recipes and uses of the listed substances, are accompanied by depictions of contemporary apothecary shops.
