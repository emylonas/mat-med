<!-- The island of San Giorgio Maggiore, opposite piazza San Marco, has housed the Benedictines since 982 CE.

In the fifteenth century the Benedictines cultivated local aromatic herbs and pumpkins, cabbages, spinach and endive in their garden; but already in the early sixteenth century there is evidence of the enlargement of the garden itself, where a section was allocated to the cultivation of olive trees.

At the same time the Monastery started to run an annexed apothecary shop, whose maintenance and supply costs are recorded until its suppression (1806).

Olive oil was the main ingredient for the Paduan Benedictines’ *Olio di Santa Giustina*, later called *Olio di San Giorgio Maggiore*, which the Venetian Monastery started to produce very early in the 16th century. The oil, also called balm, was applied externally to treat sores and wounds, and internally for gastric disorders and as a vermifuge.

It was only in 1780 that the St Giorgio Maggiore Benedictines were allowed to call their balm <em>Olio di San Giorgio Maggiore</em> – and no longer <em>Oil of Santa Giustina</em>.
This is a sheet of therapeutic indications and posology that was to accompany the sale of the oil, according to the requirements set by  the Venetian Provveditori alla Sanità</figcaption></figure>

The balm was obtained by macerating about 60 substances in olive oil, mostly local and exotic vegetables. The Benedictine grew olive trees and many local herbs and plants in their vegetable garden and in other gardens in Venice and in the Terraferma, whereas they purchased non-local and exotic substances from druggist and spices merchants.

Here there is a sample of the recipe ingredients, some of which (\*) are now acknowledged as having medicinal properties by the European Medical Agency (EMA):
* **leaves of** abrotanum (Artemisia abrotanum L.\*), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.*) etc.
* **roots of** gentian (Gentiana L.\*), peony (Paeonia L.*) etc.
* **seeds** of purslane (Portulaca L.), horseradish (Raphanus L.) etc.
* **And more:** laurel berries* (Laurus nobilis L.\*), ginger (<span style="color: #9932CC">Zingiber officinale</span>\*), carnations and cloves (<span style="color: #9932CC">Syzygium aromaticum L.</span>\*); <span style="color: #9932CC">cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum J.Presl</span>\*), nutmeg (<span style="color: #9932CC">Myristica fragrans Hott.</span>), saffron (Crocus sativus L.*) etc.;
* **four animal ingredients** (earthworms, powder of deer antlers, bull's gall, red corals); **two compound medicines** (theriac and mastic oil from Pistacia lentiscus L.*, resin), and in small quantities also stone oil (petroleum, at the time common in pharmacopoeia).

Non-local plants/herbs (<span style="color: #9932CC">violet color</span>), animal and mineral substances were bought in the bustling Venetian market by the Monastery apothecary shop, as we can see from many 16th- and 17th-century purchase notes.

San Giorgio Monastery also bought exotic substances from local merchants for other Benedictines, such as for the San Paolo Monastery in Rome: zenzero (ginger), cannella fina (cinnamon), zafran (saffron), macis (nutmeg), and many others that were not ingredients for the Balm of Santa Giustina – like galanga (<span style="color: #9932CC">Alpinia galanga Willd</span>.* from Asia) etc. </span>

Certainly the San Giorgio Maggiore garden grew peony, purslane, abrotanum, wormwood etc. and many other medicinal herbs.
In a letter sent in 1575 by the physician [Melchiorre Guilandino](/xml-minimal/index-people/#guilandino-melchiorre) to his friend and patient Alvise Mocenigo, he relates that the friars had so many Arum plants (see [wild calla lily]( https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:328149-2)).

“Il modo, che si tene in darla, & suo remedio, potrà V.M. legger nel Matthioli in capite [*Arum*](http://id.sbn.it/bid/RLZE023006]). Io non ho pronta la polvere, & a farla mi bisogneria esser costà nell’horto di frati di S. Giorgio della bella fabrica nova, dove si ritrova tanta copia di Arum che basterìa per infiammar la gola a tutta Venetia”
(Milano, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Cod. G 273, n. 69)

Roots, leaves and berries of *Arum L*., extremely hot, once cooked or pulverised were used to treat sore throats and coughs, and externally as a gout poultice. Now Arum L.
is used in herbal medicine and homeopathic medicine.

The olive trees were uprooted in 1797 to make way for the Slavonian (Croatian) troops.
