## The Garden on the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore

<figure><img src="{{ page.SGM-Barbari | relative_url }}" class="img-ctr" align="center"/></figure>

San Giorgio Maggiore island, situated opposite the piazza San Marco and close to the larger Giudecca, housed the Benedictines since 982 CE, and was also home to a vegetable garden.

In the fifteenth century the monastery cultivated much of the surrounding land with pumpkins and cabbages, spinach, endive and local aromatic herbs. But soon other plant species began to be cultivated, at first olive trees and then officinal plants.

At the same time the Monastery started to run an annexed apothecary shop, whose maintenance and supply costs are recorded until its suppression (1806).

Olive oil was the main ingredient for the Paduan Benedictines’ *Olio di Santa Giustina*, later called *Olio di San Giorgio Maggiore*, which the Venetian Monastery started to produce very early in the 16th century. The oil, also called balm, was applied externally to treat sores and wounds, and internally for gastric disorders and as a vermifuge.

It was only in 1780 that the St Giorgio Maggiore Benedictines were allowed to call their balm <em>Olio di San Giorgio Maggiore</em> – and no longer <em>Oil of Santa Giustina</em>.
This is a sheet of therapeutic indications and posology that was to accompany the sale of the oil, according to the requirements set by  the Venetian Provveditori alla Sanità</figcaption></figure>

The balm was obtained by macerating about 60 substances in olive oil, mostly local and exotic vegetables. The Benedictine grew olive trees and many local herbs and plants in their vegetable garden and in other gardens in Venice and in the Terraferma, whereas they purchased non-local and exotic substances from druggist and spices merchants.

Here there is a sample of the recipe ingredients, some of which (\*) are now acknowledged as having medicinal properties by the European Medical Agency (EMA):
* **leaves of** abrotanum (Artemisia abrotanum L.\*), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.*) etc.
* **roots of** gentian (Gentiana L.\*), peony (Paeonia L.*) etc.
* **seeds** of purslane (Portulaca L.), horseradish (Raphanus L.) etc.
* **And more:** laurel berries* (Laurus nobilis L.\*), ginger (<span style="color: #9932CC">Zingiber officinale</span>\*), carnations and cloves (<span style="color: #9932CC">Syzygium aromaticum L.</span>\*); <span style="color: #9932CC">cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum J.Presl</span>\*), nutmeg (<span style="color: #9932CC">Myristica fragrans Hott.</span>), saffron (Crocus sativus L.*) etc.;
* **four animal ingredients** (earthworms, powder of deer antlers, bull's gall, red corals); **two compound medicines** (theriac and mastic oil from Pistacia lentiscus L.*, resin), and in small quantities also stone oil (petroleum, at the time common in pharmacopoeia).

Non-local plants/herbs (<span style="color: #9932CC">violet color</span>), animal and mineral substances were bought in the bustling Venetian market by the Monastery apothecary shop, as we can see from many 16th- and 17th-century purchase notes.

San Giorgio Monastery also bought exotic substances from local merchants for other Benedictines, such as for the San Paolo Monastery in Rome: zenzero (ginger), cannella fina (cinnamon), zafran (saffron), macis (nutmeg), and many others that were not ingredients for the Balm of Santa Giustina – like galanga (<span style="color: #9932CC">Alpinia galanga Willd</span>.* from Asia) etc. </span>

Certainly the San Giorgio Maggiore garden grew peony, purslane, abrotanum, wormwood etc. and many other medicinal herbs.
In a letter sent in 1575 by the physician [Melchiorre Guilandino](/xml-minimal/index-people/#guilandino-melchiorre) to his friend and patient Alvise Mocenigo, he relates that the friars had so many Arum plants (see [wild calla lily]( https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:328149-2)).

“Il modo, che si tene in darla, & suo remedio, potrà V.M. legger nel Matthioli in capite [*Arum*](http://id.sbn.it/bid/RLZE023006]). Io non ho pronta la polvere, & a farla mi bisogneria esser costà nell’horto di frati di S. Giorgio della bella fabrica nova, dove si ritrova tanta copia di Arum che basterìa per infiammar la gola a tutta Venetia”
(Milano, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Cod. G 273, n. 69)

Roots, leaves and berries of *Arum L*., extremely hot, once cooked or pulverised were used to treat sore throats and coughs, and externally as a gout poultice. Now Arum L.
is used in herbal medicine and homeopathic medicine.

The olive trees were uprooted in 1797 to make way for the Slavonian (Croatian) troops.
