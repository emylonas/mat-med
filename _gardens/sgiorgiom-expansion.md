## Enlargement of the Gardens of San Giorgio Maggiore

Drawing of the enlargement of a corner of the garden in front of the island of Giudecca. Presumably the cultivation of olive trees ran all around the Monastery as marked in the area labelled ‘loco de li olivari.’</figcaption></figure>

In the fifteenth century the Benedictines cultivated local aromatic herbs and pumpkins, cabbages, spinach and endive in their garden; but already in the early sixteenth century there is evidence of the enlargement of the garden itself, where a section was allocated to the cultivation of olive trees.

In the plan above, the olive trees are outside the cross hatched monastery wall.
